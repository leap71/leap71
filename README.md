# Welcome to LEAP 71's Github repositories.

At [LEAP 71](https://leap71.com) we build complex technical objects using [Computational Engineering Models (CEM)](https://leap71.com/computationalengineering/). These models output parts, structures, and entire functional assemblies of machines, ready for production using advanced digital production technologies, such as industrial 3D Printing.

We use our technology to build anything from [rocket engines](https://leap71.com/rp/) to energy efficient heat exchangers or electric motors.

We are committed to supporting a growing open-source community around Computational Engineering, and are releasing many of our foundational technologies and computational models to the public.

**[PicoGK](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK)** ("peacock") is a compact and robust geometry kernel for Computational Engineering Models written in C#. Its foundation **[PicoGKRuntime](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGKRuntime)** implements the base functionality in C++ and uses other open-source projects, such as [OpenVDB](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb) and [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) as foundation.

The [LEAP 71 ShapeKernel](https://github.com/leap71/LEAP71_ShapeKernel) is a framework to build complex geometry on top of PicoGK. It provides the foundation for all of our computational models for engineering.
